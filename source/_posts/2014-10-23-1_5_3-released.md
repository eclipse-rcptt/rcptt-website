On October, 23, we released a new bugfix version of RCP Testing Tool. The complete list of fixed issues is savailable on [1.5.3 release page](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.rcptt/releases/1.5.3/bugs), and the latest version can be downloaded from [Downloads]({{site.url}}/download) page. In this topic I would like to outline a couple of my favourite improvements.

### Encryption of password fields during recording ({{m.bugzilla("436965")}})
Now, if you type a password in a password field during recording, for example in a dialog like this

<img src="{{site.url}}/shared/img/blog/1.5.3/passwords.png"/>

Then recorded script would look like this:

{% set snippet %}
with [get-window Preferences] {
    with [get-window "Edit Proxy Entry"] {
        get-editbox -after [get-label "User:"] | set-text ooo
        get-editbox -after [get-label "Password:"] 
            | set-text [decrypt "Gd3oJsWozfDNuJuSAmjCmw=="] // !! <--- decrypt
    }
}
{% endset %}
{{m.ecl(snippet, "5")}}

<br/>

So, the script does not store entered text directly, instead it records encrypted string as an argument to a special {{m.eclInline("decrypt")}} command. During test case execution, this string is being decrypted and set into text field.

<!-- break -->

RCPTT IDE considers a text box to be a password box if it either has <code class="language-java">SWT.PASSWORD</code> style bit, or <code class="language-java">Text.getEchoChar() != '\0'</code>.

This feature is useful is to avoid storing of sensitive information in test cases in plain text, however this feature does not guarantee that a passwords cannot be restored in case when intruders have an access to both test cases and application-under-test.

Encryption is performed via symmetric algorythm, there's a hard-coded predefined key, which can be overriden by setting <kbd>org.eclipse.rcptt.cryptoKey</kbd> system property in AUT &ndash; the simplest way to do this is to add <kbd>-Dorg.eclipse.rcptt.cryptoKey=anystring</kbd> in AUT VM arguments.

### Improved assertions of text editors ({{m.bugzilla("445403")}})

Now, when text editor is selected in assertion view, it is possible to see which markers this editor has, including its line, type, text and associated ruler column.
