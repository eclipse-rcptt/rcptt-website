<h3>We are on Mars now!</h3>

<p>
On June, 24, we've released Mars-based version of RCP Testing Tool as participants of Simultaneous Mars Release. <br>
So RCPTT IDE has migrated from Indigo to Mars to allow users to install it into their developer Eclipse installations.<br>

The review information is available <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.rcptt/releases/2.0-mars/review">here</a> and the latest version can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/rcptt/download/">Downloads page</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can also install RCPTT as an eclipse plugin from an Update Site or from <a href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/rcptt-eclipse-ui-testing-tool">Eclipse Marketplace</a>. 
</p>
<p>


<h3>Test Runner is now free and Open Source.</h3>
<p>
This is the first release of <b>Open Source RCPTT Runner</b>.
</p>

Now RCPTT project consists of two tools providing the whole process of automated regression testing of Eclipse-based applications:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/rcptt/documentation/userguide/getstarted/">Modern Development Environment</a> supporting debugging and refactoring.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/rcptt/documentation/userguide/runner/">Test Runner</a> allowing to run your tests locally and in integration with Jenkins, Hudson, or other CI tools.</li>
</ul>

<p>
RCPTT Test Runner tests Eclipse-based applications by executing RCPTT tests unattended, on a regular basis. <br>
It provides a command line interface and a <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/rcptt/documentation/userguide/maven/">Maven plugin</a> and establishes seamless integration of your GUI tests with your favourite toolchain.
</p>
<p>Runner is required to manage test bases greater than a dozen of tests for projects that care for development speed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Completely automated testing</li>
<li>Command line interface</li>
<li>Maven plugin</li>
<li>Works with Jenkins, Hudson, Bamboo, etc.</li>
<li>Human readable HTML report</li>
<li>JUnit or custom reports</li>
<li>Every commit can be verified by functional tests before reaching development branch</li>
<li>Handles application hangups, logs errors, stores every test step and its result</li>
</ul>

<h3>RCPTT becoming mature</h3>
<p>
We are happy to celebrate RCPTT project graduation from incubation to mature!<br>
P.S.: Will miss the egg. It was cute, though.
